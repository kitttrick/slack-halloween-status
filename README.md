## Description

With my colleague having created the original status updater for a countdown to Christmas, I thought I would see if I could tweak his idea for those of a spookier nature! All credit goes to JayDubyaEey for creating the original, and helping me enormously with my own version. Thanks John!

## Installation

You must create an application within Slack, and generate a Bot/User API key.

## Usage

Modify the Github action as you see fit, but remember to credit the OG creator: JayDubyaEey.
